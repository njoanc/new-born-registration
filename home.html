    <h3>NEW BORN REGISTRATION FORM </h3>

    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <h3>New-Born-registation-project:<strong>>this a registration project where a born
                baby is registed in one month born ,the purpose of that project
                is to view accepted children with their fathers.</strong>
        </h3>

        <P>Now days they are the problem of <em>increasing the number of single mather.</em>
            Where the affect more problem. as we develop the ideas of creating
            register form of born baby where every born baby are registed .in orther to avoid
            same consequence.
        </P>





        <p>This register will start from child birth to one months.
            As a consequence, many children were left without identification and were denied some of their rights and
            national
            services since planning focuses on the known registered children
            leaving out those that donâ€™t appear in the registry.
        </p>

        <p>this project is help to promote or to prove the right of
            children where the children have the right to have a family
            and also to combine with other categories of government to
            decrease the number of child birth without their family especially father and also
            to improve they better life of single mother
